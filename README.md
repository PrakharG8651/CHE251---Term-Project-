# CHE-251 Term Project

## Overview

This repository contains our CHE-251 Chemical Engineering term project, focusing on process simulation and optimization using DWSIM software.
We worked on the production of Acetone by dehydrogenation of Propanol.

## Project Contents

### Simulation Files

The project includes multiple DWSIM simulation files (`.dwxmz`) representing different process configurations:

- **Base_case_with_seperator.dwxmz** -  This is the base case we got from the article.
- **Base_case_optimised.dwxmz** - We added recycler in this case which improved the efficiency.
- **Base_case_purge.dwxmz** - We then added purge for cases where feed may contain inerts.

### Documentation

- **CHE251_report.pdf** - Final project report
- **Midsem report.pdf** - Mid-semester progress report
- **CHE251 TERM PROJECT PROPOSAL.docx** - Initial project proposal
- **Final presentation.pdf** - Project presentation
- **final.mp4** - Project demonstration video

## Software Requirements

- **DWSIM** - Open-source process simulation software
  - Download: [DWSIM Official Website](https://dwsim.org)
  - Version: Latest stable release recommended

## How to Use

1. Install DWSIM software on your system
2. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrakharG8651/CHE251---Term-Project-.git
   ```

3. Open any `.dwxmz` file using DWSIM to view/modify the simulation
4. Refer to the project reports for detailed analysis and methodology

## Project Objectives

- Process design and simulation
- Optimization of process parameters
- Comparative analysis of different configurations
- Economic and technical feasibility assessment

## Results and Analysis

Detailed results, analysis, and conclusions are documented in:

- `CHE251_report.pdf` - Complete findings and recommendations
- `Midsem report.pdf` - Intermediate progress and preliminary results
- `Final Presenatation` - Final presentation showing our whole project journey
